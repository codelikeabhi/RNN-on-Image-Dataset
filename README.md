# RNN-on-Image-Dataset

## LinkedIN: https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhishek-sriwastav/

This project is an image classifier that distinguishes between images of cats and dogs using deep learning techniques. The classifier is built using a recurrent neural network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells to process sequential image data. The model was trained on a dataset consisting of images scraped from various websites on the internet containing both cats and dogs.

## Project Overview

Objective: To classify images as either cats or dogs using machine learning.
Model Architecture: Utilizes LSTM cells within a recurrent neural network for sequential image data processing.
Dataset: Includes a collection of cat and dog images sourced from diverse online repositories. I used a small dataset because of hardware limitations. So, the results are not up to the mark.
Training Process: Trained the model on labeled cat and dog images to learn the distinguishing features.
Deployment: The trained model can make predictions on new images to determine whether they depict a cat or a dog.


## Usage

The provided code can be used to:
Train a similar classification model on any custom datasets.
Make predictions on new images to determine if they contain a cat or a dog.


## How to Use

Dataset Preparation: Gather a dataset containing different images and segregate it into folders.
Model Training: Use the provided code to train the model on your dataset.
Prediction: Make predictions on new images to classify them using the .pkl file.
